# riak-js : Fork from the original code by frank06 for compatibility with Thoth.

This fork was made as I discovered frank06 rewrote his riak-js adapter in Coffeescript.
As I don't intend to have another dependency between Thoth and its modules, and also think Coffeescript 
is a very bad idea (losing much expressional power, introducing even more syntax, grafting concepts onto
an language that just doesn't work that way only to reduce a bit of typing), this code base serves as a 
temporary fix.

Of course, if you do want to get Thoth working with frank06's code, feel free to do so!
